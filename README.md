Color Factory is a game made in C++ in my own engine using openGL. 
Its a factory game where the user can place conveyor belts and different types of machines to mix and create different paints. 
I mainly used this game to learn openGL and learn how to make a game outside of the usual Unity or Unreal Engine environments.
