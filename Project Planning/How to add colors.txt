This is a "short" guide on how to add colors realistically 

Using RGB doesnt work for things like adding blue and yellow.
It should make green, but it makes grey. 0 0 1 + 1 1 0 = .5 .5 .5, not 0 .5 0

Better way to do it is converting to CMYK

cian magenta yellow black. It uses suptractive mixing instead of additive mixing

This makes green out of yellow and cian(close enough to blue)
0 0 1 0 + 1 0 0 0 = 1 0 1 0 which is green

There is a very simple formula to convert from CYMK to RGB, and it should only ever
have to go one way. 
All the math and color mixing in game will happen in CYMK, and then 
when it needs to be rendered it will be converted to RGB for openGL

unfortunately, there is no "perfect" way of converting CYMK to RGB.
This is because they are not in the same color gamut. 
CMYK is smaller than RGB, but some of the values in the CMYK gamut
are not inside of the RGB gamut. This means that when converting 
those colors will be lost.
This problem will also make most of the conversions look incorrect 
when comparing the RGB to the CMYK.

However, this may not be a problem for the game, because as long as the 
colors are close enough so that the player can still logically figure out
what two colors need to be mixed together to create it, they will never notice.
